The former Principal Engineer at Unity and Engine Director of Insomniac Games volunteered to mentor me. We discussed professional career and explored low-level programming topics with a focus in speed, data and simplicity. He taught me how to properly face engineering problems that I considered interesting and complicated. In general he made me grow very much as a programmer.
